# Imortant Message ✉️

* In this frontend as well as backend part I had removed my local IP address, you must enter you local IP address there. For mac users the IP address will be 
availabel at System Preference -> Network -> Wifi -> Advanced -> TCP/IP -> IPv4 Address(will be present there).

* Still there are things to complete as well as to implement, If you find this app intresting than hit me up; I will be
glad to work with you.

# Backend(Server) 🗼
The backend files are provided in my another repository.
